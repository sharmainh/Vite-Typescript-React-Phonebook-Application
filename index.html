<!-- React is using JavaScript to inject all of its content into the div id root (see line 10) -->
<!-- for this application we are using/typing 'npm run dev ' in the terminal, no longer 'npm start' like we did for the react small application because 'npm run dev' is what vite uses as its script. (See package.json file) HOWEVER you can change the word 'dev' (line 8) to whatever 'applesauce' instead of the word dev then the command in the terminal would be 'npm run applesauce' -->
